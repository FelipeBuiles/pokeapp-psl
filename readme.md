# Pokeapp

This is an implementation of a technical test for PSL

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have node.js installed in your machine to run a development version, I'll upload a bundled dist folder as requested so you may run the finished product without it.

If you only want to see the finished product, just open ``index.html`` on the dist folder.

### Installing

First you need to install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

Then you can run the dev server by running

```
npm run dev
```

When you're finished making changes, you may build a distribution version by running

```
npm run build
```

## Built With
